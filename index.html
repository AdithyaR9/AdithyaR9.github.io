        <h2>Guitar</h2>
        <p class="text-highlight">Playing guitar has always been a passion of mine. I enjoy learning new songs and improvising on the fretboard.</p>
        <p>Whether itâ€™s acoustic or electric, the guitar allows me to express myself creatively. I also enjoy experimenting with different genres like rock, blues, and classical.</p>
